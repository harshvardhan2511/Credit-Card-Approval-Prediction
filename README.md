# Problem Statement:

Credit risk as the board in banks basically centers around deciding the probability of a customer’s default or credit decay and how expensive it will end up being assuming it happens. It is important to consider major factors and predict beforehand the probability of consumers defaulting given their conditions.
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!).

# Objective:

We want to automate this task of prediction with the power of machine learning (I have used Logistic Regression) and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
